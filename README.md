# SchoolSimulator
Visual-Novel-esque school simulator put together with Python and Pygame

<h2>Game Details</h2>

Created for Club Crawl 2018/19 <br>
Business of Video Games

Play through an emmersive story following the love between a cute girl at your highschool and you: a cliche school boy, a weirdo or a secret alien (however you decide to portray yourself).

There are 3 Chapters, with 7 different scripts to play through.

To run the game, simply open/run <i>main.pyw</i> through Python 2 or 3. Python and Pygame are both required to run the game.

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

Written completely in Python using Pygame, a game development module. Code is very short (less than 500 lines), clean and readable. Source code is seperated into three different files for more readability and a more organized design. The game presents slick transition animations, coded without the use of an animation module. 

Programmed by Derek Zhang with assistance of Yi Deng<br>

Script written by Stephen Hwang and Khushwant Virdi<br>
