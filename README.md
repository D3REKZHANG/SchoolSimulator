# SchoolSimulator
Visual-Novel-esque school simulator put together with Python and Pygame

<h2>Game Details</h2>

Created for Club Crawl 2018/19 <br>
Business of Video Games

Time spent: 10 hours (coding)

Play through an emmersive story about high school life.

There are 3 Chapters, with 7 different scripts to play through.

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

Written completely in Python using Pygame, a game development module. Code is very short (less than 500 lines), clean and readable. Source code is seperated into three different files for more readability and a more organized design. The game presents slick transition animations, coded without the use of an animation module. 

Automatically parses story script files so that story changes can be made on the fly (no hardcoding).

This code can easily be reused with different story dialogues and character sprites.
